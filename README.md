# GATE CSE GPT, The problem and solution

A chatbot-GPT powered by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) & [Pathway](https://pathway.com/).

Aims in helping students with interview and other common doubts, related to GATE CSE exam, specifically who are facing difficulty in affording coachings.
With the help of [Pathway's LLM App](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app). and a [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) at backend, aims to help students to ace the GATE exam with free resources, helping in Post-GATE interviews and the main exam, test series equally.

The main idea is to have a shared dropbox account, with write acess to a handful of students across all IIT's, to share relavent insights about campus life, placements and interview experiences.
All of the resources will be stored in the drop-box and using these, the GPT will generate a real-time and relevent guide. 
Widely used GPT's like ChatGPT, â€ŽGemini cannot produce real-time and student curated answers like this bot-GPT will produce.


This repo is mostly a modification of [Dropbox-ai-chat](https://github.com/pathway-labs/dropbox-ai-chat/tree/main)

# CAUTION
This project is under development. I am commiting for a bootcamp evaluation, will need to modify a lot before it's ready to use.
It's not recommended to use this as of now. This is using a GPT-2 as of now and is full of hallucinations. 
As of now the dropbox is only having standard textbooks, needed for the GATE exam.
I am not sharing the books here, as there might be copyright problems.
We'll also have standard books along with interview experiences and campus information at our backend, once we have enough money to use GPT-4 and a machine to host our website 24x7.

## Demo

See how the tool will look once ready:

This shall also be very helpful for students, who are planning to switch from btech in non-CSE to mtech in CSE, as there are many students who are taking this path and there is very less helpful resource online to guide them properly.
