# GATE CSE GPT, The problem and solution

A chatbot-GPT powered by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) & [Pathway](https://pathway.com/).

Aims in helping students with interview and other common doubts, related to GATE CSE exam, specifically who are facing difficulty in affording coachings.
With the help of [Pathway's LLM App](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app). and a [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) at backend, aims to help students to ace the GATE exam with free resources, helping in Post-GATE interviews and the main exam, test series equally.

The main idea is to have a shared dropbox account, with write acess to a handful of students across all IIT's, to share relavent insights about campus life, placements and interview experiences.
All of the resources will be stored in the drop-box and using these, the GPT will generate a real-time and relevent guide. 
Widely used GPT's like ChatGPT, â€ŽGemini cannot produce real-time and student curated answers like this bot-GPT will produce.

This repo is mostly a modification on [Dropbox-ai-chat](https://github.com/pathway-labs/dropbox-ai-chat/tree/main)

# CAUTION
This project is under development. I am commiting for a bootcamp evaluation, will need to modify a lot before it's ready to use.
It's not recommended to use this as of now. This is using a GPT-2 as of now and is full of hallucinations.
